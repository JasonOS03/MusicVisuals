## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment

## Aimee

## Neil

## Jade
This code creates a visual display that moves to music. It creates a screen where shapes and colors change with the beat of a song.

The background colour changes depending on how loud the music is. Softer music will make the background pink, while louder music will make it darker. I used an if statement here so when the msuic is below 300Hz the screen is pink.

I created a visual along the bottom of the screen that is triangles moving up and down on the screen. Each triangle represents the bass or high notes. They get taller or shorter based on how loud each part of the music is. 

I also added stars which are located  by using the random function in java. They appear and disappear and their size changes with the musics volume. When the music is loud you'll see bigger stars. For this I had to intialise arrays and a for loop to find the position and then a for loop to draw the stars.

# How it works

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

## Aimee

## Neil

## Jade
I was most proud of how far I had came from the beginning of the project. I found this a big challenge and im very happy with the end result. The hardest challenge I overcame was the stabbing effect at the bottom of the screen, it was very difficult to figure out the variables and the positioning of this. I was very happy with the outcome of this section of the visual because I thought this idea would be out of my depths but I achieved it with research and time. The next thing im most proud of is the stars, this was a joint effort between me and another member of the team, neil, the reason we curated this aspect of the visual was to create a sense of unity between our visuals, and in the end i was very impressed with the outcome.
