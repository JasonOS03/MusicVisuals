# Music Visualiser Project

Names: Aimee Mcgrane, Neil Fitzgerald, Jade Thornton, Jason O Sullivan, Chris Noblett 

Student Numbers: C22393606, C22405604, C22394466, C22400796, C22454222

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment

## Jason
My first role in this project was to set up the GitHub repository. I created the repository and then sent invitations to the rest of the group to join.I also had to make sure my visual worked in coordination with the other visuals. I created and worked on one visual which was constantly updated and committed.

The visual I created was what I would describe as a vortex. The first part of the visual I created was the the vortex itself , spanning around the sides of the screen. This vortex contains the colors from green all the way to red , and I did this using the map function.The vortex reacts to the audio by swirling around in a circular motion and pulsating. The vortex was created using lines, and these lines represent the gusts of wind.

The next part of the visual I created was the inner ring , which is a bright pink color. this circle rotates by the amplitude value in radians and also pulsates by the amplitude amount. The color also changes sporadically as the beat tempo / amplitude increases. The final part of the visual I created was a ring of circles rotating around the inner circle. These circles are also a bright pink color , and the colors also change at peak amplitude. This ring of circles is essentially pulled around the inside of the vortex.

# How it works

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

In this assignment I am most proud of my creative thinking to come up with an interesting visual. This creative thinking continued throughout the whole project , leading to the visual constantly evolving and changing over time. I was able to constantly think of new ideas which I am very proud of. 

I really felt that I learned a lot during the creation of this visual. One thing I really got a good understanding of is how to make the objects rotate and respond well to the audio buffer. I gained a better understanding of how the parameters and coordinates work in the PApplet functions , such as the circle and the rotate function. This project really helped to enhance my skills in using PApplet and also further improved my Java coding skills and my understanding of the Java language

This project also helped to enhance my group working skills and communication as we had to spend a lot of time co-ordinating our visuals and grouping them together. This co-ordination required constant communication the full way through the project. I also learned the importance of working bit by bit instead of trying to tackle the entire project in a very short amount of time.
